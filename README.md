# DA623-ASCII-Character-Conversion-

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text-based visual art in general.

The above .ipynb file converts any given image to its corresponding ASCII art.
